Algorithm B
Input:
- A CNF formula F
- Parameters: max_tries ∈ N, max_loops ∈ N, p ∈ [0, 1]

Output:
- A satisfying assignment for F, or FAIL

Begin
1. Color Assignment
	a. Construct graph G where each node represents a variable in F.
	b. For each clause in F, add edges between all pairs of variables within the clause.
	c. GreedyColoring(G) to assign a color to each variable.
	d. Organize variables into color classes based on their assigned colors.

2. Search for satisfying assignment:
	a. Repeat for each try from 1 to max_tries:
    	i. Initialize a random truth assignment σ for all variables in F.
   	 
    	ii. Repeat for each loop from 1 to max_loops:
        	- If σ satisfies F, terminate and return σ.
       	 
        	- Identify the set of unsatisfied clauses under σ.
       	 
        	- For each color class C in the color assignment:
            	1. Extract clauses from the unsatisfied set that include at least one variable from C.
            	2. If no such clauses exist, proceed to the next color class.
            	3. Randomly select a clause C' from the extracted clauses.
           	 
            	4. With probability p:
                	a. Randomly flip the variable from C' that belongs to color class C.
            	5. Else with probability 1-p:
                	a. For each variable in F belonging to color class C, compute its break-count.
                	b. Select the variable with the minimum break-count.
           	 
            	6. Flip the truth value of the selected variable in σ.
           	 
	b. If no satisfying assignment is found after max_tries, return FAIL.
